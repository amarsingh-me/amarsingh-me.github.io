# Object Oriented Programing 
When we talk about programing then there are two kinds of paradigm that exists 
1. Functional Programing 
2. Object Oriented Programing 

In functional Programing the emphasis is mainly on creating step function, which can execute one operation at a time. But the biggest drawback is in its strength. It is hard to maintain and hard to reuse. 
To overcome these challenges OOPs comes with four main concepts:
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance 
4. Polymorphism
Let's check them one by one. 
## Abstraction
Abstraction is a process of hiding implementation details and exposing only the functionality to the user. In abstraction we deal with idea not the action, for example if driver is applying breaks, driver doesn't have to be expert in creating breaks, as long as driver can understand what breaking means it is good enough. 

```
This means user will only know "What it does" rather than "how it is done".
```
